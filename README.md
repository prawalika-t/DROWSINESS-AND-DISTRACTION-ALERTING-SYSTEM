# DROWSINESS-AND-DISTRACTION-ALERTING-SYSTEM
Our project develops a device to detect driver drowsiness or distraction, enhancing road safety. While luxury vehicles offer similar features, they remain imperfect. Using Python and OpenCV, we employ image detection, machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing for precise driver state monitoring.
